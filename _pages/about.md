I am a PhD student in physics at the University of Arizona working in astronomy and cosmology under [Eduardo Rozo](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/eduardo-rozo). My main interest is survey cosmology, the study of the structure of the universe on massive scales using data catalogs made by looking at huge portions of the sky with a big telescope over many years.

I am currently working with data from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://www.sdss.org/) (SDSS) and the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) (DES). SDSS has imaged slightly over $1/3$ of the night sky over the last 18 years from Apache Point Observatory in southern New Mexico. DES, the current state of the art, has imaged only about $10\%$ of the sky over the last 5 years but finds much fainter objects than SDSS. For a comparison, SDSS found about 350 million objects (this includes stars and galaxies) while DES found about 300 million galaxies in its much smaller area since it goes so much deeper.

## Professional

I am also a member in the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/) (DESC) where I actively participate in the clusters working group. Within DESC, I am assisting with the development of a software pipeline to quantify the bias in stacked cluster analyses that is compatible with both real data and the cosmology likelihood analysis.

I am currently working on measuring the scatter in the richness-mass relation of a complete sample of SDSS redMaPPer galaxy clusters. We have obtained Chandra X-ray Observatory measurements of the gas mass of the clusters and are jointly fitting for both the richness-mass relation and the gas mass-mass relation to constrain the scatter.

On the side, I am working with [Dennis Zaritsky](http://djuma.as.arizona.edu/~dennis/) on measuring the dependence of environment on the morphology of galaxies falling into small galaxy clusters. Using spectra taken on a low-dispersion prism, we have calculated redshifts with low uncertainties (order of magnitude better than photometric redshifts, order of magnitude worse than spectroscopic redshifts) for about 30,000 galaxies in clusters from the ESO Distance Cluster Survey (EDisCS). Using these redshifts, we can easily associate each galaxy either with an EDisCS cluster or with the field and make statements about the local cluster environment.

This past year, I was funded through the [University of Arizona/Nasa Space Grant](https://spacegrant.arizona.edu/students/fellowships). The Space Grant is a graduate fellowship that funds four graduate students each year in space science related fields to perform outreach in the local community. For my outreach project, I proposed a revision of the content in the Space Gallery at the [Pima Air and Space Museum](http://www.pimaair.org/), the largest privately owned air and space museum in the US. Over the last year, I have put together content on unmanned NASA missions and the planets of our Solar System to be put on display in the gallery, replacing about $1/3$ of the existing content in the gallery.

## Personal
<img src="../images/astro_tcg.jpg" width="200px" align="left" hspace="30"> In my spare time, I run an online storefront selling Magic: The Gathering trading cards called [Astro TCG](https://shop.tcgplayer.com/sellerfeedback/346ad38b). It has taken over all of the free space in my apartment! 

After purchasing collections of cards, usually thousands at a time, they need to be sorted and graded before I can enter anything into inventory. <br clear="left">

Beyond work and the store, I love both playing and running Dungeons & Dragons games. I run one weekly fifth edition game using an online virtual table top with my friends from college and play in one weekly game with other graduate students in my year.
