### Summary
The Core Cosmology Library (CCL) is a C library (with a python interface) to compute pre-validated cosmological predictions over a wide range of cosmological parameters. Using CCL, cosmologists will be able to compare their analysis results to ΛCDM predictions without having to worry about numerical accuracy or validating the ΛCDM predictions.

### Contribution
I performed a comparison between the different physical constants published in external sources and those used in CCL and its dependencies. My work ensured consistency between CCL and its dependencies.

### Abstract
The Core Cosmology Library (CCL) provides routines to compute basic cosmological  observables with validated numerical accuracy. The output of these routines has been successfully compared, to an accuracy level documented herein, against the results of the Code Comparison Project. In the current version, predictions are provided for distances and background quantities, angular auto- and cross spectra of cosmic shear and clustering, and the halo mass function. Fiducial specifications for the expected LSST galaxy distributions and clustering bias are also included, together with the capability of computing redshift distributions for a user-defined photometric redshift model. CCL is written in C, with a Python interface.
